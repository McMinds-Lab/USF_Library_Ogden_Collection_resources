# USF Library Ogden Collection resources

Repository to contain annotation workflow code, basic databases such as controlled vocabulary, and perhaps draft workflows, instructions, or data presentation products (like R Shiny apps) - any of which might later be developed into libguides or use other USF Library-specific resources.

If you're new to GitHub, coding, or data management, feel free to look at the resources I've collected in my lab's general repository: https://github.com/McMinds-Lab/analysis_templates
