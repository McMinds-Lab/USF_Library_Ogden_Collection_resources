# USF Library Ogden Collection resources

Repository to contain annotation workflow code, basic databases such as controlled vocabulary, and perhaps draft workflows, instructions, or data presentation products (like R Shiny apps) - any of which might later be developed into libguides or use other USF Library-specific resources.

If you're new to GitHub, coding, or data management, feel free to look at the resources I've collected in my lab's general repository: https://github.com/McMinds-Lab/analysis_templates

Existing controlled vocabulary file is just a start. Each row in that file would correspond to a column in the final product. Ideally, we should be able to find wider standards rather than invent our own (e.g. I found this with a quick google, and while we probably don't want to get too fancy with XML and specialized tools like this (?), we could at least copy a relevant subset of their pre-defined vocabulary: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5638456/)
